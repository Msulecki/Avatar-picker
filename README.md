# Avatar picker
This is my attempt to create an avatar picker from [JoinColony/coding-challenge](https://github.com/JoinColony/coding-challenge)

### [Live demo](https://msulecki.github.io/Avatar-picker/)
****

## Installation
````
$ git clone https://github.com/Msulecki/Avatar-picker.git
$ npm start
````
It's better to work on original JoinColony repo, not my interpretarion.
